        <p>Cloud based ‘Business Apps’ are a productivity phenomenon that’s reshaping most areas of business... not just IT. That’s why 80% of SME’s already utilise cloud apps to run faster and smoother. For instance, the Government just moved 50% of its operations into the cloud. So while business owners scramble to make complex decisions in-house on how to optimise, save and sell more, you could just call 1800 Cloud Gurus and receive some expert, impartial, free advice on&nbsp;which cloud business apps suit your needs, how to use them properly or how to create new ones.

In our view, there are two roles in a company; sales and sales enablement. All other titles within the business are to enable these two drivers only. Cloud Gurus provides sales strategies that help you improve your front-line teams and optimise your ability to convert opportunities into outcomes. Building pipelines, member databases, fresh leads, channel partner opportunities or soft selling via content marketing and social media all require cloud based solutions to compete effectively. <br><br>

Our maxim when it comes to salesis the more you know, the better you sell. The only way to know more is to analyse what’s happening in your business via clever tracking, detailed analytics and accurate reports. A consistent adjustment to your sales & marketing plans based on business intelligence is key to staying in the black.

It needs to be secure, easy to use, intuitive, and most of all effective. Choosing the correct CRM and getting the most out it takes time and resources. Get it wrong and you’ll spend months or years re-training your workforce before you can begin heading down the right path.<br><br>

The usual rule of thumb is 2 x profit for a standard business and 10 x profit for a businesswith the capacity to build a member database that grows via ‘non-touch’ methods. Generally the latter requires a platformto handle simultaneous users joining and utilising services with little human involvement.<br><br>

                        	No strategy or project will have a great outcome unless a great Solutions Architect drives it. Cloud Gurus can provide end-to-end Solution Architecture to ensure the various solutions within your new or established business come to life.   
We provide Solution Architecture services ad hoc for important projects, or we can provide ongoing part-time Solution Architects on a retainer basis. Given that most SME’s don’t have the budget to retain a full time Solution Architect, external retainer based services can exceed expectations by acquiring an in-depth understanding of your business model and the key drivers behind your critical initiatives.   
What is a Solutions Architect? <br><br>
                            The role of Solutions Architect requires knowledge and skills that are both broad and deep. To be effective, the Solutions Architect must have experience with multiple hardware and software environments and be comfortable with complex heterogeneous system environments. The individual is often a highly seasoned technocrat who has led multiple projects through the Software Development Process or Systems Development Life Cycle(SDLC)and performed a variety of different roles within the realm. A Solutions Architect requires the skill to concisely communicate written and verbal initiatives to executive staff, business sponsors, and technical resources in the vernacular specific to each group. <br><br>
                            Practitioners of Solution Architecture, cloud systems engineering and software engineering processes, Solutions Architects organisethe development effort of systemsolutions. They are responsible for the development of the global vision that underpins the projected solution and transforms this through execution into the solution. Solutions Architects become involved in a project at the time of inception, are involved in the Functional Analysis (FA) of developing initial requirements and remain involved throughout the balance of the project.   <br><br>
                            Proficient Solutions Architects are experts in many categories. They have extensive practical experience in multiple industries across several disciplines and manage a variety of hardware platforms including mainframes, distributed platforms, desktops, and mobile devices. In addition, they also possessexpertise in multiple operating systemsand comprehensive knowledge of databases.<br><br>   
                            Solutions Architects decide which technologies to use. They work closely with developers to ensure proper implementationand are the link between the needs of the organisation and developers.  <br><br>
                            
                            
                            Solutions Architects in large organisations often act as the bridge between Enterprise Architects and Application Architects.   <br><br>
                            An Enterprise Architect’s deliverables are usually more abstract than a Solution Architect’s. The main distinction lies in their purpose. The Enterprise Architect is primarily employed in the design, planning and governance of strategic and cross-organisational rationalisation or optimisation of an enterprise’s services, processes or componentswhile the Solution Architect is primarily employed to assist project managers in the design, planning and governance of implementation projects.   <br><br>
                            
                            A Solutions Architect may have a reporting line to an Enterprise Architect,whose scope of influence depends on the organisational policies and management structure. Consequently, the extent to which a Solutions Architect’s work is derived from Enterprise Architect road maps will vary considerably.<br><br>
                            
                            When the Solutions Architect role starts and stops depending on the funding model for the process of solution identification and delivery. An enterprise may employ a Solutions Architect on a feasibility studyor to prepare a solution vision or outline for an Invitation to Tender, a supplier may employ a Solutions Architect at “bid time ”before an implementation project is costed or resourced or both may employ the Solutions Architect to govern an implementation projectand play an intrinsic role.<br><br>
                            
                            An IT services provider may employ a Solutions Architect in a role reporting to a senior architect who is:   <br><br>
                            1. Focused on operational services rather than implementation programme/projects where the understanding of managed operations is important.
                            2. Responsible for coordinating all services provided to one organisation by way of strategy, business consulting, projects and operational services.   
                            3. Working on a bid to supply one organisation with the services above, or a framework bidto cover more than one customer organisation at a more strategic level. 
                            <br><br>
                            In cases 2 and 3, the senior architect is akin to an Enterprise Architect, but in the UK and Australia, is likely to be titled Technical Director (CTO).   <br><br>

                            If you sell products, attract or serve members, provide critical services, feed live data, drive traffic and/or run effective marketing campaigns, your site needs to run smoothly and at a cracking pace when your customers arrive.

                        	Cloud based SAAS has been around for a long time.Even ‘Facebook’ is a cloud based SAAS platform and anything serving customers online in an automated fashion is considered SAAS. Strategic cloud based business and mobile apps deliver similarly effective outcomes if planned well and built on a robust cloud based platform.  <br><br> 

                            Regardless of the purpose, applications generally serve users/clients (SAAS), are available on all devices from anywhere (mobility), are highly scalable and elastic (cloud) and named accordingly as they are launched via an icon on your desktop or mobile device. When you see SAAS, think customer satisfaction via the cloud.<br><br>
                            
                            Cloud Gurus has built some of the most extensive SAAS projects in the Sothern Hemisphere. Watch the video on www.AT2.com.au or  www.AuditionMagic.com to see the level of experience and quality we bring to the table when leading, creating and evolving scalable cloud based SAAS projects. We take your new concept or existing business through the correct steps from start to finish.<br><br>
                            
                            To see our approach for all cloud projects (apps (SAAS / PAAS / IAAS) sites and platforms), read our Mobile & Business App Creation service description.

                        	Cloud Gurus can help you design the right cloud based IT solution to meet your unique requirements. We can migrate you to chosen services, then manage and support them - freeing up your time and money for more important business issues.<br><br>   

                            Stepping up the complexity scale, Cloud Gurus is experienced in moving servers, storage and core applications into public, private and hybrid clouds.   Rather than purchasing expensive server hardware and software, these are delivered as a service and paid subscription, avoiding high upfront capital costs.  <br><br>
                            
                            When infrastructure and software are outsourced, coupled with services to support and maintain them,you focus on what your organisation does best without the burden of IT operational management and capital expenses. <br><br>  
                            
                            With data, security, performance and infrastructure implications to be considered, it’s not as simplistic as saying “put my servers in the cloud” but with the correct cloud strategy - properly executed - can empowerbusinesses to reduce complexity and capital expense and regain focus.

                        	Our award winning business app / platform development team has been building custom bespoke business solutions for over 10 years. Depending on the project, we deliver via our own local team, or dedicated OS team if your budget is limited.Frequently, clients require a mix of bothso we break our services into two categories:   <br><br> 

                            (Option 1) A full custom solution where our team pulls apart your plan, defines your requirements, adds significant value to the required solution and delivers in accordance with the agreed specification. Theadvantage is that you own the IP 100% which increases the value of company assets. You can also reuse this application for other industries and/or white label your cloud app as a SAAS (Software As A Service) product to the wider market, including your competitors. This of course is a more expensive option than using existing cloud apps. Ask yourself if you eventually wish to sell your enterprise for a competitive price or if you prefer to operate as cost effectively as possible for now. A good business strategy can help you make these important decisions.   <br><br>
                            
                            (Option 2)  A hybridstrategy where we deliver the assessed solution through utilising 3rd party plug-in cloud apps / SAASto provide theoutcome you require. Cloud Gurus defines requirements, researches the correct cloud apps and adds value to your ideas. We then build custom components to incorporate specific apps under one login and custom branded system to simulate a custom bespoke solution relying on other services to seamlessly function. This solution is less expensive than option 1but cannot be reused for other than the original intended purpose. However, if you are looking for speed to market and a lean business model… a hybrid custom solution may be perfect for your needs.You canupgrade toa full custom business app/platform if you need to. Evaluate your business strategy with us correctly before makingthesesignificant decisions.
