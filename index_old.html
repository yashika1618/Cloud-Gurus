                                      <br><span class="bold-text">What is a Solutions Architect?</span> 
                                      <br>The role of Solutions Architect requires the knowledge and skills that are both broad and deep. To be effective, the Solutions Architect must have experience on multiple Hardware and Software Environments and be comfortable
                                      with complex heterogeneous system environments. The Solutions Architect is often a highly seasoned senior technocrat who has led multiple projects through the Software Development Process or Systems Development Life
                                      Cycle (SDLC), and has usually performed in a variety of different roles in that life cycle. The person needs an ability to share and communicate ideas clearly, both orally and in writing, to executive staff, business
                                      sponsors, and technical resources in clear concise language that is the parlance of each group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                      <br>
                                      <br>A practitioner of Solution Architecture, cloud systems engineering and software engineering processes, the Solutions Architect is the person who organises the development effort of a systems solution. The Solutions
                                      Architect is responsible for the development of the overall vision that underlies the projected solution and transforms that vision through execution into the solution. The Solutions Architect becomes involved with
                                      a project at the time of inception and is involved in the Functional Analysis (FA) of developing the initial requirements. They then remain involved throughout the balance of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                      <br>
                                      <br>The Solutions Architect is an expert in many categories. They should have hands-on experience in multiple industries and across several disciplines. They can master a variety of hardware platforms including mainframes,
                                      distributed platforms, desktops, and mobile devices. Akin to that they should also possess skill and understanding of a variety of operating systems. A broad and deep understanding of databases is also required.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                      <br>
                                      <br>Solutions Architects decide which technologies to use. They work very closely with developers to ensure proper implementation. They are the link between the needs of the organisation and the developers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                      <br>
                                      <br>Positioning Solutions Architects in relation to Enterprise Architects; Solutions Architects in large organisations often act as the bridge between Enterprise Architects and Application Architects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                      <br>
                                      <br>An Enterprise Architect’s deliverables are usually more abstract than a solution architect’s deliverables. But that is not always the case, and the main distinction between Enterprise Architect and Solution Architect
                                      lies in their different motivations. The Enterprise Architect is primarily employed in the design, planning and governance of strategic and cross-organisational rationalisation or optimisation of an enterprise’s services,
                                      processes or components.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                      <br>
                                      <br>The Solution Architect is primarily employed to help project managers in the design, planning and governance of implementation projects of any kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                      <br>
                                      <br>A Solutions Architect may have a reporting line to an Enterprise Architect, but the influence the Enterprise Architect team has on Solutions Architects depends on an organisation’s policies and management structure.
                                      So, the extent to which a Solutions Architect’s work derives from Enterprise Architects’ road maps will vary from 0 to 100 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                      <br>
                                      <br>When the Solutions Architect starts and stops depends on the funding model for the process of solution identification and delivery. E.g. An enterprise may employ a Solutions Architect on a feasibility study, or to
                                      prepare a solution vision or solution outline for an Invitation to Tender. A supplier may employ a solution architect at “bid time”, before any implementation project is costed or resourced. Both may employ a Solutions
                                      Architect to govern an implementation project, or play a leading role within it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                      <br>
                                      <br>An IT services provider may employ a Solutions Architect in a role that reports to a senior architect who is:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                      <br>
                                      <br>1. focused on operational services rather than implementation programme/projects, where understanding managed operations is important.
                                      <br>
                                      <br>2. responsible for coordinating all services provided to one organisation by way of strategy, business consulting, projects and operational services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                      <br>
                                      <br>3. working on a bid to supply one organisation with all the services above, or a framework bid that covers more than one customer organisation at a more strategic level. In cases 2 and 3, the senior architect is akin
                                      to an Enterprise Architect, but (in the UK and Australia at least) is more likely to be called Technical Director or CTO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                      <br>
                                      <br>Having a multi-skilled, passionate, talented and experienced Solutions Architect embedded in your business could be a game changing move towards the company you’ve always dreamt of. Cloud Gurus can provide this. One

                                      as building cloud based business apps and mobile apps. These are all new buzzwords that deliver very similar outcomes as long as they are all built on a robust cloud based platform. &nbsp;

                                      <br>Regardless of what purpose the project intends to deliver, they are most likely serving users / clients (SAAS), available on all devices from anywhere (mobility), highly scalable and elastic (cloud) yet considered
                                      to be an app given it can be launched via an app icon that sits on your desktop or mobile device. So when you see SAAS, think customer satisfaction via the cloud.

                                          with the agreed specification. The big upside here is that you own this IP 100% and therefore it increases the value of your company assets. You can also reuse this application for other industries and/or white

                                          you wish to sell your company one day for a very high price or are you happy staying as lean as possible for now? A good business strategy can help you make these important decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                          Gurus defines requirements, researches the correct cloud apps and adds value to your ideas. We then build the custom components that pull a number of apps together under one login and custom branded system so
                                          you can provide the feel of a custom bespoke solution even though your new cloud platform will be relying on many other services to function smoothly. This solution is less expensive than option 1 and cannot be
                                          reused for anything other than the original intended purpose. However, if you are looking for speed to market and a lean business model… a hybrid custom solution may be perfect to get you started. You can always
                                          decide to switch to building a full custom business app/platform when/if you need to. Again, get your business strategy right first before you make these large decisions.</div>

                                teams and optimise your ability to convert opportunities into outcomes. Building pipelines, member databases, fresh leads, channel partner opportunities or soft selling via content marketing and social media all require
                                cloud based solutions to compete effectively.&nbsp;
                                <br>
                                <br>Our motto when it comes to sales; the more you know – the better you sell. And the only way to know more is to analyse what’s happening in your business via clever tracking, detailed analytics and accurate reports. A consistent
                                adjustment to your sales &amp; marketing plans based on business intelligence is key to staying in the black.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

                              <br>The role of Solutions Architect requires the knowledge and skills that are both broad and deep. To be effective, the Solutions Architect must have experience on multiple Hardware and Software Environments and be comfortable
                              with complex heterogeneous system environments. The Solutions Architect is often a highly seasoned senior technocrat who has led multiple projects through the Software Development Process or Systems Development Life Cycle
                              (SDLC), and has usually performed in a variety of different roles in that life cycle. The person needs an ability to share and communicate ideas clearly, both orally and in writing, to executive staff, business sponsors,
                              and technical resources in clear concise language that is the parlance of each group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>A practitioner of Solution Architecture, cloud systems engineering and software engineering processes, the Solutions Architect is the person who organises the development effort of a systems solution. The Solutions Architect
                              is responsible for the development of the overall vision that underlies the projected solution and transforms that vision through execution into the solution. The Solutions Architect becomes involved with a project at the
                              time of inception and is involved in the Functional Analysis (FA) of developing the initial requirements. They then remain involved throughout the balance of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>The Solutions Architect is an expert in many categories. They should have hands-on experience in multiple industries and across several disciplines. They can master a variety of hardware platforms including mainframes, distributed
                              platforms, desktops, and mobile devices. Akin to that they should also possess skill and understanding of a variety of operating systems. A broad and deep understanding of databases is also required.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>Solutions Architects decide which technologies to use. They work very closely with developers to ensure proper implementation. They are the link between the needs of the organisation and the developers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>Positioning Solutions Architects in relation to Enterprise Architects; Solutions Architects in large organisations often act as the bridge between Enterprise Architects and Application Architects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>An Enterprise Architect’s deliverables are usually more abstract than a solution architect’s deliverables. But that is not always the case, and the main distinction between Enterprise Architect and Solution Architect lies
                              in their different motivations. The Enterprise Architect is primarily employed in the design, planning and governance of strategic and cross-organisational rationalisation or optimisation of an enterprise’s services, processes
                              or components.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>The Solution Architect is primarily employed to help project managers in the design, planning and governance of implementation projects of any kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>A Solutions Architect may have a reporting line to an Enterprise Architect, but the influence the Enterprise Architect team has on Solutions Architects depends on an organisation’s policies and management structure. So, the
                              extent to which a Solutions Architect’s work derives from Enterprise Architects’ road maps will vary from 0 to 100 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>When the Solutions Architect starts and stops depends on the funding model for the process of solution identification and delivery. E.g. An enterprise may employ a Solutions Architect on a feasibility study, or to prepare
                              a solution vision or solution outline for an Invitation to Tender. A supplier may employ a solution architect at “bid time”, before any implementation project is costed or resourced. Both may employ a Solutions Architect
                              to govern an implementation project, or play a leading role within it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>An IT services provider may employ a Solutions Architect in a role that reports to a senior architect who is:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>1. focused on operational services rather than implementation programme/projects, where understanding managed operations is important.
                              <br>
                              <br>2. responsible for coordinating all services provided to one organisation by way of strategy, business consulting, projects and operational services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>3. working on a bid to supply one organisation with all the services above, or a framework bid that covers more than one customer organisation at a more strategic level. In cases 2 and 3, the senior architect is akin to an
                              Enterprise Architect, but (in the UK and Australia at least) is more likely to be called Technical Director or CTO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>Having a multi-skilled, passionate, talented and experienced Solutions Architect embedded in your business could be a game changing move towards the company you’ve always dreamt of. Cloud Gurus can provide this. One client

Let Cloud Gurus give you the right game plan before you invest heavily in any solution that may not suit you long-term. We are not an IT team (that’s just a small part of what we offer),
                              we provide strategies that drive profit.&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>There are many ‘cloud consulting’ experts available, and we respect everyone has the right to earn their place in this space. However, can your cloud consultants show you how they started, evolved and/or restructured multiple
                              companies in order to run faster and smoother, with less overheads and risk? We can.

                              <br>Cloud Gurus helps with both the reinvention of your back-end and front-end systems via qualified accountants, lawyers, award winning creative talent and business strategists. We then partner with you and provide constant
                              value on how to maintain your business with new age thinking. We are local, approachable, transparent and most of all, accountable.&nbsp;

                              <br>Cloud Gurus has just opened the world’s first retail store in South Yarra, Melbourne, Australia, so that our clients can come in and have a face-to-face meeting anytime. We can’t hide under the desk when you arrive so it’s
                              fair to say we must deliver strategy that is highly appreciated – otherwise we would be hiding in a corporate suite somewhere avoiding the phone!</div>

                              <br>
                              <br>If you sell products, attract or serve members, provide critical services, feed live data, drive traffic and/or run effective marketing campaigns your site needs to run smoothly and run at a cracking pace when your customers
                              arrive. The only solutions that allow for this level of performance are the world’s leading cloud hosting platforms.
                              <br>
                              <br>In addition, your Responsive Cloud Website needs to provide a great experience on all web devices such as desktop, laptop, tablet, mini tablet, phablet and mobile phone. Therefore Responsive Cloud Sites have actually superseded
                              the value of device specific Mobile Apps as they cover over 20 screen / browser / operating systems with the one responsive site. Less web traffic = less sales conversations = less profit.
                              <br>
                              <br>Cloud Gurus specialise in Responsive Cloud Sites as we have been building them for the international market 10 years using the latest web based technologies and brands. One client site still generates over 20M in revenue
                              per year. Prices range anywhere from $3,000 and beyond.

                              <br>website. A great site should work responsively on all desktop and mobile platforms and should not require a different ‘app’ built for each. With each site you receive:

                              cloud based business apps and mobile apps. These are all new buzzwords that deliver very similar outcomes as long as they are all built on a robust cloud based platform. &nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>Regardless of what purpose the project intends to deliver, they are most likely serving users / clients (SAAS), available on all devices from anywhere (mobility), highly scalable and elastic (cloud) yet considered to be an
                              app given it can be launched via an app icon that sits on your desktop or mobile device. So when you see SAAS, think customer satisfaction via the cloud.
                              <br>
                              <br>Cloud Gurus have built some of the biggest SAAS projects in the Sothern Hemisphere. Watch the video on www.AT2.com.au or&nbsp; www.AuditionMagic.com to see the level of experience and quality we bring to the table when leading,

                                <br>When your infrastructure and software are outsourced - coupled with the services to support and maintain them - it allows you to focus on what your organisation does best without being burdened by the operational management

                                  <br><span class="bold-text">(1)&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A full custom solution where our team pulls apart your plan, defines your requirements, adds significant value to the required solution and delivers in accordance with the
                                  agreed specification. The big upside here is that you own this IP 100% and therefore it increases the value of your company assets. You can also reuse this application for other industries and/or white label your new
                                  cloud app as a SAAS (Software As A Service) product to the wider market, including your competitors. The downside is that it is more expensive than using existing cloud apps. The question is, do you wish to sell your
                                  company one day for a very high price or are you happy staying as lean as possible for now? A good business strategy can help you make these important decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                  defines requirements, researches the correct cloud apps and adds value to your ideas. We then build the custom components that pull a number of apps together under one login and custom branded system so you can provide
                                  the feel of a custom bespoke solution even though your new cloud platform will be relying on many other services to function smoothly. This solution is less expensive than option 1 and cannot be reused for anything other
                                  than the original intended purpose. However, if you are looking for speed to market and a lean business model… a hybrid custom solution may be perfect to get you started. You can always decide to switch to building a
                                  full custom business app/platform when/if you need to. Again, get your business strategy right first before you make these large decisions.</div>

                              using new cloud apps alone, every time they get released. There are millions available and each day more amazing new cloud apps and SAAS platforms arrive on the scene. That’s why researching these services is overwhelming
                              and exhausting. When you don’t have a background in creating cloud platforms, you don’t know what to look for and your job becomes even harder.&nbsp;

                                <br>In our view, there are two roles in a company; sales, or sales enablement. All other titles within the business are to enable these two drivers only. Cloud Gurus provides sales strategies that help you improve your front-line
                                teams and optimise your ability to convert opportunities into outcomes. Building pipelines, member databases, fresh leads, channel partner opportunities or soft selling via content marketing and social media all require

                              <br>The role of Solutions Architect requires the knowledge and skills that are both broad and deep. To be effective, the Solutions Architect must have experience on multiple Hardware and Software Environments and be comfortable
                              with complex heterogeneous system environments. The Solutions Architect is often a highly seasoned senior technocrat who has led multiple projects through the Software Development Process or Systems Development Life Cycle
                              (SDLC), and has usually performed in a variety of different roles in that life cycle. The person needs an ability to share and communicate ideas clearly, both orally and in writing, to executive staff, business sponsors,
                              and technical resources in clear concise language that is the parlance of each group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>The Solutions Architect is an expert in many categories. They should have hands-on experience in multiple industries and across several disciplines. They can master a variety of hardware platforms including mainframes, distributed
                              platforms, desktops, and mobile devices. Akin to that they should also possess skill and understanding of a variety of operating systems. A broad and deep understanding of databases is also required.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>Solutions Architects decide which technologies to use. They work very closely with developers to ensure proper implementation. They are the link between the needs of the organisation and the developers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>When the Solutions Architect starts and stops depends on the funding model for the process of solution identification and delivery. E.g. An enterprise may employ a Solutions Architect on a feasibility study, or to prepare
                              a solution vision or solution outline for an Invitation to Tender. A supplier may employ a solution architect at “bid time”, before any implementation project is costed or resourced. Both may employ a Solutions Architect
                              to govern an implementation project, or play a leading role within it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>An IT services provider may employ a Solutions Architect in a role that reports to a senior architect who is:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>1. focused on operational services rather than implementation programme/projects, where understanding managed operations is important.
                              <br>
                              <br>2. responsible for coordinating all services provided to one organisation by way of strategy, business consulting, projects and operational services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>3. working on a bid to supply one organisation with all the services above, or a framework bid that covers more than one customer organisation at a more strategic level. In cases 2 and 3, the senior architect is akin to an
                              Enterprise Architect, but (in the UK and Australia at least) is more likely to be called Technical Director or CTO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>Having a multi-skilled, passionate, talented and experienced Solutions Architect embedded in your business could be a game changing move towards the company you’ve always dreamt of. Cloud Gurus can provide this. One client

Let Cloud Gurus give you the right game plan before you invest heavily in any solution that may not suit you long-term. We are not an IT team (that’s just a small part of what we offer),
                              we provide strategies that drive profit.&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>There are many ‘cloud consulting’ experts available, and we respect everyone has the right to earn their place in this space. However, can your cloud consultants show you how they started, evolved and/or restructured multiple
                              companies in order to run faster and smoother, with less overheads and risk? We can.

                              <br>Cloud Gurus helps with both the reinvention of your back-end and front-end systems via qualified accountants, lawyers, award winning creative talent and business strategists. We then partner with you and provide constant
                              value on how to maintain your business with new age thinking. We are local, approachable, transparent and most of all, accountable.&nbsp;

                              <br>Cloud Gurus has just opened the world’s first retail store in South Yarra, Melbourne, Australia, so that our clients can come in and have a face-to-face meeting anytime. We can’t hide under the desk when you arrive so it’s
                              fair to say we must deliver strategy that is highly appreciated – otherwise we would be hiding in a corporate suite somewhere avoiding the phone!</div>

                              <br>
                              <br>If you sell products, attract or serve members, provide critical services, feed live data, drive traffic and/or run effective marketing campaigns your site needs to run smoothly and run at a cracking pace when your customers
                              arrive. The only solutions that allow for this level of performance are the world’s leading cloud hosting platforms.
                              <br>
                              <br>In addition, your Responsive Cloud Website needs to provide a great experience on all web devices such as desktop, laptop, tablet, mini tablet, phablet and mobile phone. Therefore Responsive Cloud Sites have actually superseded
                              the value of device specific Mobile Apps as they cover over 20 screen / browser / operating systems with the one responsive site. Less web traffic = less sales conversations = less profit.
                              <br>
                              <br>Cloud Gurus specialise in Responsive Cloud Sites as we have been building them for the international market 10 years using the latest web based technologies and brands. One client site still generates over 20M in revenue
                              per year. Prices range anywhere from $3,000 and beyond.

                              <br>We do not believe our customers should have to login and familiarise themselves with different systems or allocate separate budgets to build different phone and/or tablet apps in addition to a

                              cloud based business apps and mobile apps. These are all new buzzwords that deliver very similar outcomes as long as they are all built on a robust cloud based platform. &nbsp;

                              <br>Regardless of what purpose the project intends to deliver, they are most likely serving users / clients (SAAS), available on all devices from anywhere (mobility), highly scalable and elastic (cloud) yet considered to be an
                              app given it can be launched via an app icon that sits on your desktop or mobile device. So when you see SAAS, think customer satisfaction via the cloud.

                                <br>When your infrastructure and software are outsourced - coupled with the services to support and maintain them - it allows you to focus on what your organisation does best without being burdened by the operational management

                                  budget is super lean. Usually clients require a mix of both. We break our offering down into two categories:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                  <br>
                                  <br><span class="bold-text">(1)&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A full custom solution where our team pulls apart your plan, defines your requirements, adds significant value to the required solution and delivers in accordance with the
                                  agreed specification. The big upside here is that you own this IP 100% and therefore it increases the value of your company assets. You can also reuse this application for other industries and/or white label your new
                                  cloud app as a SAAS (Software As A Service) product to the wider market, including your competitors. The downside is that it is more expensive than using existing cloud apps. The question is, do you wish to sell your
                                  company one day for a very high price or are you happy staying as lean as possible for now? A good business strategy can help you make these important decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                  <br><span class="bold-text">(2)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;A hybrid solution where we deliver the required solution utilising existing 3rd party plug-in cloud apps / SAAS that provide most of the functions you require. Cloud Gurus
                                  defines requirements, researches the correct cloud apps and adds value to your ideas. We then build the custom components that pull a number of apps together under one login and custom branded system so you can provide
                                  the feel of a custom bespoke solution even though your new cloud platform will be relying on many other services to function smoothly. This solution is less expensive than option 1 and cannot be reused for anything other
                                  than the original intended purpose. However, if you are looking for speed to market and a lean business model… a hybrid custom solution may be perfect to get you started. You can always decide to switch to building a
                                  full custom business app/platform when/if you need to. Again, get your business strategy right first before you make these large decisions.</div>

                              using new cloud apps alone, every time they get released. There are millions available and each day more amazing new cloud apps and SAAS platforms arrive on the scene. That’s why researching these services is overwhelming
                              and exhausting. When you don’t have a background in creating cloud platforms, you don’t know what to look for and your job becomes even harder.&nbsp;

                              <br>The role of Solutions Architect requires the knowledge and skills that are both broad and deep. To be effective, the Solutions Architect must have experience on multiple Hardware and Software Environments and be comfortable
                              with complex heterogeneous system environments. The Solutions Architect is often a highly seasoned senior technocrat who has led multiple projects through the Software Development Process or Systems Development Life Cycle
                              (SDLC), and has usually performed in a variety of different roles in that life cycle. The person needs an ability to share and communicate ideas clearly, both orally and in writing, to executive staff, business sponsors,
                              and technical resources in clear concise language that is the parlance of each group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>A practitioner of Solution Architecture, cloud systems engineering and software engineering processes, the Solutions Architect is the person who organises the development effort of a systems solution. The Solutions Architect
                              is responsible for the development of the overall vision that underlies the projected solution and transforms that vision through execution into the solution. The Solutions Architect becomes involved with a project at the
                              time of inception and is involved in the Functional Analysis (FA) of developing the initial requirements. They then remain involved throughout the balance of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>The Solutions Architect is an expert in many categories. They should have hands-on experience in multiple industries and across several disciplines. They can master a variety of hardware platforms including mainframes, distributed
                              platforms, desktops, and mobile devices. Akin to that they should also possess skill and understanding of a variety of operating systems. A broad and deep understanding of databases is also required.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>Solutions Architects decide which technologies to use. They work very closely with developers to ensure proper implementation. They are the link between the needs of the organisation and the developers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>Positioning Solutions Architects in relation to Enterprise Architects; Solutions Architects in large organisations often act as the bridge between Enterprise Architects and Application Architects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>An Enterprise Architect’s deliverables are usually more abstract than a solution architect’s deliverables. But that is not always the case, and the main distinction between Enterprise Architect and Solution Architect lies
                              in their different motivations. The Enterprise Architect is primarily employed in the design, planning and governance of strategic and cross-organisational rationalisation or optimisation of an enterprise’s services, processes
                              or components.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>The Solution Architect is primarily employed to help project managers in the design, planning and governance of implementation projects of any kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>A Solutions Architect may have a reporting line to an Enterprise Architect, but the influence the Enterprise Architect team has on Solutions Architects depends on an organisation’s policies and management structure. So, the
                              extent to which a Solutions Architect’s work derives from Enterprise Architects’ road maps will vary from 0 to 100 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>When the Solutions Architect starts and stops depends on the funding model for the process of solution identification and delivery. E.g. An enterprise may employ a Solutions Architect on a feasibility study, or to prepare
                              a solution vision or solution outline for an Invitation to Tender. A supplier may employ a solution architect at “bid time”, before any implementation project is costed or resourced. Both may employ a Solutions Architect
                              to govern an implementation project, or play a leading role within it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>An IT services provider may employ a Solutions Architect in a role that reports to a senior architect who is:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>1. focused on operational services rather than implementation programme/projects, where understanding managed operations is important.
                              <br>
                              <br>2. responsible for coordinating all services provided to one organisation by way of strategy, business consulting, projects and operational services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>3. working on a bid to supply one organisation with all the services above, or a framework bid that covers more than one customer organisation at a more strategic level. In cases 2 and 3, the senior architect is akin to an
                              Enterprise Architect, but (in the UK and Australia at least) is more likely to be called Technical Director or CTO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>Having a multi-skilled, passionate, talented and experienced Solutions Architect embedded in your business could be a game changing move towards the company you’ve always dreamt of. Cloud Gurus can provide this. One client

Let Cloud Gurus give you the right game plan before you invest heavily in any solution that may not suit you long-term. We are not an IT team (that’s just a small part of what we offer),
                              we provide strategies that drive profit.&nbsp;
                              <br>
                              <br>There are many ‘cloud consulting’ experts available, and we respect everyone has the right to earn their place in this space. However, can your cloud consultants show you how they started, evolved and/or restructured multiple
                              companies in order to run faster and smoother, with less overheads and risk? We can.

                              <br>Cloud Gurus helps with both the reinvention of your back-end and front-end systems via qualified accountants, lawyers, award winning creative talent and business strategists. We then partner with you and provide constant
                              value on how to maintain your business with new age thinking. We are local, approachable, transparent and most of all, accountable.&nbsp;

                              <br>Cloud Gurus has just opened the world’s first retail store in South Yarra, Melbourne, Australia, so that our clients can come in and have a face-to-face meeting anytime. We can’t hide under the desk when you arrive so it’s
                              fair to say we must deliver strategy that is highly appreciated – otherwise we would be hiding in a corporate suite somewhere avoiding the phone!</div>

                              <br>In addition, your Responsive Cloud Website needs to provide a great experience on all web devices such as desktop, laptop, tablet, mini tablet, phablet and mobile phone. Therefore Responsive Cloud Sites have actually superseded
                              the value of device specific Mobile Apps as they cover over 20 screen / browser / operating systems with the one responsive site. Less web traffic = less sales conversations = less profit.

                              <br>Cloud Gurus specialise in Responsive Cloud Sites as we have been building them for the international market 10 years using the latest web based technologies and brands. One client site still generates over 20M in revenue
                              per year. Prices range anywhere from $3,000 and beyond.

                              <br>website. A great site should work responsively on all desktop and mobile platforms and should not require a different ‘app’ built for each. With each site you receive:

                              cloud based business apps and mobile apps. These are all new buzzwords that deliver very similar outcomes as long as they are all built on a robust cloud based platform. &nbsp;

                              <br>Regardless of what purpose the project intends to deliver, they are most likely serving users / clients (SAAS), available on all devices from anywhere (mobility), highly scalable and elastic (cloud) yet considered to be an
                              app given it can be launched via an app icon that sits on your desktop or mobile device. So when you see SAAS, think customer satisfaction via the cloud.

                                  <br><span class="bold-text">(1)&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;A full custom solution where our team pulls apart your plan, defines your requirements, adds significant value to the required solution and delivers in accordance with the
                                  agreed specification. The big upside here is that you own this IP 100% and therefore it increases the value of your company assets. You can also reuse this application for other industries and/or white label your new
                                  cloud app as a SAAS (Software As A Service) product to the wider market, including your competitors. The downside is that it is more expensive than using existing cloud apps. The question is, do you wish to sell your
                                  company one day for a very high price or are you happy staying as lean as possible for now? A good business strategy can help you make these important decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                  defines requirements, researches the correct cloud apps and adds value to your ideas. We then build the custom components that pull a number of apps together under one login and custom branded system so you can provide
                                  the feel of a custom bespoke solution even though your new cloud platform will be relying on many other services to function smoothly. This solution is less expensive than option 1 and cannot be reused for anything other
                                  than the original intended purpose. However, if you are looking for speed to market and a lean business model… a hybrid custom solution may be perfect to get you started. You can always decide to switch to building a
                                  full custom business app/platform when/if you need to. Again, get your business strategy right first before you make these large decisions.</div>
