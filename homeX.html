        <p>Cloud based ‘Business Apps’ are a productivity phenomenon that’s reshaping most areas of business... not just IT. That’s why 80% of SME’s already utilise cloud apps to run faster and smoother. For instance, the Government just moved 50% of its operations into the cloud. So while business owners scramble to make complex decisions in-house on how to optimise, save and sell more, you could just call 1800 Cloud Gurus and receive some expert, impartial, free advice on&nbsp;which cloud business apps suit your needs, how to use them properly or how to create new ones.

                            <br>When we started My Workforce (a new business), we had the opportunity to create a new set of efficiencies within our internal operations from the beginning, but were also challenged with how to create a complete

We utilise existing cloud solutions or create new ones to deliver this outcome, but essentially we are business strategists with a background in innovative thinking. Unless we can add significant value to your current plan, or provide a strategy that reduces overheads and empowers growth, we will be the first to suggest the appropriate provider – your total business performance success is our only priority.
                          <br>
                          <br>We are passionate about all business – optimising reinventing the old, and launching the new. If you are planning to launch a new business; have you thought about how much your project will cost to get off the ground? What are your operational expenses; will you need investors? How will you target them? Our team of experts can put together a strategy congruent to your goals and ideas as discovered in a details concept development / project discovery session to help you plan for growth and success.

                        	Choosing the right 3rd party business apps and other cloud solutions is critical. If you get this wrong, you may spend years undoing these mistakes – factor the downtime cost of re-training staff on how to operate daily using new cloud apps alone, every time they get released. There are millions available and each day more amazing new cloud apps and SAAS platforms arrive on the scene. That’s why researching these services is overwhelming and exhausting. When you don’t have a background in creating cloud platforms, you don’t know what to look for and your job becomes even harder. <br><br> 

Cloud Gurus will find the right cloud solutions for your business so you or your team can focus on your strengths of leading and winning business. If the 3rd party cloud apps you need doesn’t exist, we can create anything you need or just the custom components that act as a layer on top of what’s already out there.  <br><br>

There is no need to reinvent the wheel, but we can certainly make sure your wheels are race ready, robust and built for speed. This requires practical thinking, past business experience and solid research.

                        	The term ‘sales’ sometimes feels dirty, and not everyone likes calling themselves a ‘sales person’. Yet in reality, effective selling is the single most important function in any business striving for profit. <br><br> 

In our view, there are two roles in a company; sales, or sales enablement. All other titles within the business are to enable these two drivers only. Cloud Gurus provides sales strategies that help you improve your front-line teams and optimise your ability to convert opportunities into outcomes. Building pipelines, member databases, fresh leads, channel partner opportunities or soft selling via content marketing and social media all require cloud based solutions to compete effectively.  <br><br>

Our motto when it comes to sales; the more you know – the better you sell. And the only way to know more is to analyse what’s happening in your business via clever tracking, detailed analytics and accurate reports. A consistent adjustment to your sales & marketing plans based on business intelligence is key to staying in the black.

They need to be secure, easy to use, intuitive and most of all effective. Choosing the correct CRM and getting the most out it takes time and resources. Get it wrong and you’ll spend months or years re-training your workforce before you can even begin heading down the right path.<br><br>

Cloud Gurus specialises in finding the right CRM for your business structure and then helping your sales teams use it effectively.

The usual rule of thumb is 2 x profit for a standard business and 10 x profit for a business that has the capacity to build a member database that grows via ‘non-touch’ methods. Generally the latter requires a platform that can handle simultaneous users joining and enjoying your services with little human involvement. <br><br>

So whether it’s list building via marketing campaigns (EDM’s and social media), or B2B channel deals that’s builds your database via resellers and affiliate marketing. Thus these traceable and critical processes are all now managed in the cloud.

                            We provide Solution Architecture services ad hoc for important projects, or we can provide ongoing part-time Solution Architects on a retainer basis. Given most SME’s don’t have the budget to retain a full time Solution Architect, retainer based services generally exceed expectations when an external resource gains an in-depth understanding of your business model and key drivers behind your critical initiatives.    <br><br>
                            
                            <strong>What is a Solutions Architect? </strong>
                            The role of Solutions Architect requires the knowledge and skills that are both broad and deep. To be effective, the Solutions Architect must have experience on multiple Hardware and Software Environments and be comfortable with complex heterogeneous system environments. The Solutions Architect is often a highly seasoned senior technocrat who has led multiple projects through the Software Development Process or Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and has usually performed in a variety of different roles in that life cycle. The person needs an ability to share and communicate ideas clearly, both orally and in writing, to executive staff, business sponsors, and technical resources in clear concise language that is the parlance of each group.    <br><br>
                            
                            A practitioner of Solution Architecture, cloud systems engineering and software engineering processes, the Solutions Architect is the person who organises the development effort of a systems solution. The Solutions Architect is responsible for the development of the overall vision that underlies the projected solution and transforms that vision through execution into the solution. The Solutions Architect becomes involved with a project at the time of inception and is involved in the Functional Analysis (FA) of developing the initial requirements. They then remain involved throughout the balance of the project.   <br><br> 
                            
                            The Solutions Architect is an expert in many categories. They should have hands-on experience in multiple industries and across several disciplines. They can master a variety of hardware platforms including mainframes, distributed platforms, desktops, and mobile devices. Akin to that they should also possess skill and understanding of a variety of operating systems. A broad and deep understanding of databases is also required.    <br><br>
                            
                            Solutions Architects decide which technologies to use. They work very closely with developers to ensure proper implementation. They are the link between the needs of the organisation and the developers.  <br><br> 
                            
                            Positioning Solutions Architects in relation to Enterprise Architects; Solutions Architects in large organisations often act as the bridge between Enterprise Architects and Application Architects.   <br><br>
                            
                            An Enterprise Architect’s deliverables are usually more abstract than a solution architect’s deliverables. But that is not always the case, and the main distinction between Enterprise Architect and Solution Architect lies in their different motivations. The Enterprise Architect is primarily employed in the design, planning and governance of strategic and cross-organisational rationalisation or optimisation of an enterprise’s services, processes or components.    <br><br>
                            
                            The Solution Architect is primarily employed to help project managers in the design, planning and governance of implementation projects of any kind.  <br><br>  
                            
                            A Solutions Architect may have a reporting line to an Enterprise Architect, but the influence the Enterprise Architect team has on Solutions Architects depends on an organisation’s policies and management structure. So, the extent to which a Solutions Architect’s work derives from Enterprise Architects’ road maps will vary from 0 to 100 percent.    <br><br>
                            
                            When the Solutions Architect starts and stops depends on the funding model for the process of solution identification and delivery. E.g. An enterprise may employ a Solutions Architect on a feasibility study, or to prepare a solution vision or solution outline for an Invitation to Tender. A supplier may employ a solution architect at “bid time”, before any implementation project is costed or resourced. Both may employ a Solutions Architect to govern an implementation project, or play a leading role within it. <br><br>   
                            
                            An IT services provider may employ a Solutions Architect in a role that reports to a senior architect who is:<br><br>    
                            <ol type="1">
                            	<li>focused on operational services rather than implementation programme/projects, where understanding managed operations is important. </li>
                                <li>responsible for coordinating all services provided to one organisation by way of strategy, business consulting, projects and operational services.</li>
                                <li>working on a bid to supply one organisation with all the services above, or a framework bid that covers more than one customer organisation at a more strategic level. In cases 2 and 3, the senior architect is akin to an Enterprise Architect, but (in the UK and Australia at least) is more likely to be called Technical Director or CTO.</li>
                            </ol> 
                            <br><br>
                            Having a multi-skilled, passionate, talented and experienced Solutions Architect embedded in your business could be a game changing move towards the company you’ve always dreamt of. Cloud Gurus can provide this. One client project includes the Solutions Architecture for www.Lexus.com.au.

We are not an IT team (that’s just a small part of what we offer), we provide strategies that drive profit. <br><br> 

There are many ‘cloud consulting’ experts available, and we respect everyone has the right to earn their place in this space. However, can your cloud consultants show you how they started, evolved and/or restructured multiple companies in order to run faster and smoother, with less overheads and risk? We can. <br><br>

Cloud Gurus helps with both the reinvention of your back-end and front-end systems via qualified accountants, lawyers, award winning creative talent and business strategists. We then partner with you and provide constant value on how to maintain your business with new age thinking. We are local, approachable, transparent and most of all, accountable.  <br><br>

Cloud Gurus has just opened the world’s first retail store in South Yarra, Melbourne, Australia, so that our clients can come in and have a face-to-face meeting anytime. We can’t hide under the desk when you arrive so it’s fair to say we must deliver strategy that is highly appreciated – otherwise we would be hiding in a corporate suite somewhere avoiding the phone!

                        	We all know that the biggest bookkeeping and accounting brands have converted to offering cloud software-as-a-service (SAAS) platforms.  <br><br>

This allows CFO’s, directors and book-keepers instant access to the financials, and protects business owners from falling behind or failing to implement agreed financial strategies that drive growth and keep the business safe. <br><br>

Cloud Gurus work with the biggest accounting brands to best utilise their cloud platforms in the most effective and strategic way possible. Our qualified cloud accounting consultants offer a level of quality advice and execution you can expect from leading accounting firms. <br><br>

Our driver is profit, and accountability and great leadership in financial management starts with moving into the cloud. We can provide a pure strategy role and help your financial team perform better, or we can provide ongoing end-to-end cloud accounting management.

                        	Real websites that deliver serious results require a bulletproof ‘elastic’ cloud platform that scales up and down during the highs and lows of business. Why is this so important? <br><br>

                            If you sell products, attract or serve members, provide critical services, feed live data, drive traffic and/or run effective marketing campaigns your site needs to run smoothly and run at a cracking pace when your customers arrive. The only solutions that allow for this level of performance are the world’s leading cloud hosting platforms. <br><br>
                            
                            In addition, your Responsive Cloud Website needs to provide a great experience on all web devices such as desktop, laptop, tablet, mini tablet, phablet and mobile phone. Therefore Responsive Cloud Sites have actually superseded the value of device specific Mobile Apps as they cover over 20 screen / browser / operating systems with the one responsive site. Less web traffic = less sales conversations = less profit. <br><br>
                            
                            Cloud Gurus specialise in Responsive Cloud Sites as we have been building them for the international market 10 years using the latest web based technologies and brands. One client site still generates over 20M in revenue per year. Prices range anywhere from $3,000 and beyond. <br><br>

                            We do not believe our customers should have to login and familiarise themselves with different systems or allocate separate budgets to build different phone and/or tablet apps in addition to a website. A great site should work responsively on all desktop and mobile platforms and should not require a different ‘app’ built for each. With each site you receive: <br><br>

                        	Cloud based SAAS has been around for a long time. Did you know Facebook is a cloud based SAAS platform? Anything that serves customers online in an automated fashion is considered SAAS. It’s essentially the same thing as building cloud based business apps and mobile apps. These are all new buzzwords that deliver very similar outcomes as long as they are all built on a robust cloud based platform. 
                                      <br>
                                      <br>Regardless of what purpose the project intends to deliver, they are most likely serving users / clients (SAAS), available on all devices from anywhere (mobility), highly scalable and elastic (cloud) yet considered
                                      to be an app given it can be launched via an app icon that sits on your desktop or mobile device. So when you see SAAS, think customer satisfaction via the cloud.

                            <br>Stepping up the complexity scale, Cloud Gurus is experienced in moving servers, storage and core applications into public, private and hybrid clouds. &nbsp; Rather than purchasing expensive server hardware and software,
                            you instead have these delivered as a service and paid as a subscription, avoiding high upfront capital costs.
                            <br>
                            <br>When your infrastructure and software are outsourced - coupled with the services to support and maintain them - it allows you to focus on what your organisation does best without being burdened by the operational
                            management and capital expense of running IT. 
                            <br>
                            <br>With data, security, performance and infrastructure implications that need to be considered, it’s not always as easy as saying “put all my servers in the cloud”. But, the right cloud strategy - properly executed
                            - can allow businesses to reduce complexity and capital expense, and regain focus.

                              with the agreed specification. The big upside here is that you own this IP 100% and therefore it increases the value of your company assets. You can also reuse this application for other industries and/or white
                              label your new cloud app as a SAAS (Software As A Service) product to the wider market, including your competitors. The downside is that it is more expensive than using existing cloud apps. The question is, do
                              you wish to sell your company one day for a very high price or are you happy staying as lean as possible for now? A good business strategy can help you make these important decisions.

                              Gurus defines requirements, researches the correct cloud apps and adds value to your ideas. We then build the custom components that pull a number of apps together under one login and custom branded system so
                              you can provide the feel of a custom bespoke solution even though your new cloud platform will be relying on many other services to function smoothly. This solution is less expensive than option 1 and cannot be
                              reused for anything other than the original intended purpose. However, if you are looking for speed to market and a lean business model… a hybrid custom solution may be perfect to get you started. You can always
                              decide to switch to building a full custom business app/platform when/if you need to. Again, get your business strategy right first before you make these large decisions.
